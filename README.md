## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Javier Acevedo. I'm a Front-end Web Developer, specializing in Vue, React. Aside from my professional life I have experience with other languages such as C, C#, and python. 

In my spare time I like to build stuff such as:

- [meshell](https://github.com/javieracevedo/meshell): unix-like shell
- [chip-8](https://github.com/javieracevedo/chip-8-emulator) interpreter/emulator
- [superfluo](https://github.com/javieracevedo/superfluo-timer): rubik's cube timer
- [ostep-projects](https://github.com/javieracevedo/ostep-projects): operative system projects from the OSTEP book.

To build these projects I use the following languages:

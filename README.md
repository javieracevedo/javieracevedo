## Hello There ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Javier Acevedo. I'm a Senior FullStack Engineer. Aside from my professional life, I have experience with other languages such as C, C#, Go, Ruby, and Python. 

In my spare time, I like to build stuff such as:

- [chip-8](https://github.com/javieracevedo/chip-8-emulator) interpreter/emulator.
- [ostep-projects](https://github.com/javieracevedo/ostep-projects): operative system projects from the OSTEP book.
- [turbolover](https://github.com/javieracevedo/turbolover): http/1.1 server in Ruby.
- [gosh](https://github.com/javieracevedo/gosh): an unix-like shell in Go.
- [rshell](https://github.com/javieracevedo/rshell): an unix-like shell in Ruby. 
- [meshell](https://github.com/javieracevedo/meshell): second **attempt** of an unix-like shell in C. 
- [sharpong](https://github.com/javieracevedo/sharpong): pong's clone in C# and monogame.
- [superfluo](https://github.com/javieracevedo/superfluo-timer): rubik's cube timer.

To build these projects I've used the following languages:

## Hello There ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Javier Acevedo. I'm a Senior Front-end Web Developer, specializing in Vue, and React. Aside from my professional life, I have experience with other languages such as C, C#, and Python. 

In my spare time, I like to build stuff such as:

- [chip-8](https://github.com/javieracevedo/chip-8-emulator) interpreter/emulator
- [ostep-projects](https://github.com/javieracevedo/ostep-projects): operative system projects from the OSTEP book.
- [sharpong](https://github.com/javieracevedo/sharpong): pong's clone in C# and monogame
- [meshell](https://github.com/javieracevedo/meshell): second **attempt** of unix-like shell in C. 


I'm currently working on:

- [gosh](https://github.com/javieracevedo/gosh): unix like shell in Go
- [superfluo](https://github.com/javieracevedo/superfluo-timer): rubik's cube timer

To build these projects I've used the following languages:
